  cd SolanaBlockChain
```
2. Install dependencies:

## üî• Code Explanation

Wallet-Connect-Button.tsx

- This component manages wallet connection logic.

### Key Functions:

- Connecting a Wallet: Uses useWallet() and useWalletModal() to open a wallet selection modal.

- Displaying the Wallet Address: Once connected, the public key is displayed with a truncated format (XXXX...YYYY).

- Dropdown Menu Options:

- Copy Address (copies the public key to the clipboard)

- Disconnect (disconnects the wallet)

### Code Breakdown:
```next.js
const { publicKey, connected, disconnect, wallet } = useWallet();
```
- Fetches the current wallet connection state.

```next.js
if (!connected || !publicKey) {
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => setVisible(true)}>
      Connect Wallet
    </Button>
  );
}
```

- If no wallet is connected, the "Connect Wallet" button appears.

```next.js
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => navigator.clipboard.writeText(publicKey.toBase58())}>
  Copy address
</DropdownMenuItem>
```

- Copies the wallet address when clicked.

```next.js
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => disconnect()}>
  Disconnect
</DropdownMenuItem>
```
- Disconnects the wallet.

```
vercel login
```
Step 3: Deploy the Project
```
vercel
```
- Vercel will ask you to link the project. Just follow the prompts and it will be deployed.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Netlify
If you prefer Netlify, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Netlify CLI
```
npm install -g netlify-cli
```
Step 2: Login to Netlify
```
netlify login
```
Step 3: Build the Project
```
npm run build

Step 4: Deploy the Project
```
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Hosting with Docker
If you want to deploy on a VPS or cloud server, use Docker.

- Step 1: Build the Docker Image
```
docker build -t my-nextjs-app .
```
- Step 2: Run the Docker Container
```
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-nextjs-app
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Mastery (Next.js + Tailwind + UI Components)
- Reusable UI Components: I created buttons, dropdowns, and wallet connection UI in a modular way, making them reusable for future projects.

- State Management: I efficiently used useState and useEffect to prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance.

- SSR vs CSR: Working with Next.js helped me understand Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs Client-Side Rendering (CSR).

‚úÖ Lesson: You're now confident in Next.js and can build scalable, interactive frontends efficiently.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Blockchain & Web3 Integration (Solana Wallet Connect)
- Solana Wallet Connection: I successfully integrated wallet connection, public key retrieval, and disconnect handling.

- Clipboard Copy Feature: I implemented an address copy feature, which is a common real-world crypto app requirement.

- UX Improvements: I learned how different wallets (Phantom, Solana) interact with the UI and improve the user experience.

‚úÖ Lesson: Now I know how wallet integration works in Web3 and why UX is crucial in blockchain applications.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging & Problem-Solving
- Hydration Error Fix: I solved the Next.js hydration issue by using a mounted state to avoid rendering SSR elements before the client is ready.

- Wallet Not Connecting Issue: I understood that when the wallet isn‚Äôt connected, publicKey is null, and learned how to handle such cases.

- Cross-Browser Testing: I tested the app in different browsers and wallet extensions, which is crucial for debugging Web3 applications.

‚úÖ Lesson: Web3 debugging requires extra attention, and now you have real-world problem-solving experience.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Hosting Knowledge
- Vercel, Netlify, Docker, Railway: I explored multiple deployment options and successfully deployed on Vercel.

- CI/CD Concepts: I understood how GitHub auto-deploys work, and how production setups are managed.

‚úÖ Lesson: Now, I can deploy full-stack projects independently, which is valuable for freelancing and real-world applications.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Project Planning & Documentation
- Requirements Analysis: I first understood the project requirements before implementing features, which is an important development skill.

- Real-World Features: I implemented wallet connect, address copy, and a dynamic UI, which are commonly used features in blockchain projects.

‚úÖ Lesson: Software development is not just about writing code‚Äîplanning and documentation are equally important.

### Final Takeaway
- üî• My frontend skills improved significantly
- üî• I got hands-on Web3 integration experience
- üî• My debugging and problem-solving abilities leveled up
- üî• I understood deployments and hosting in depth
- üî• I realized the importance of planning and documentation
